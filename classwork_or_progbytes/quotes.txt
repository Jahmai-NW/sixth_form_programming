To be or not to be, that is the question.
If you tell the truth, you don't have to remember anything.
You can't fall if you don't climb. But there's no joy in living your whole life on the ground.
It always seems impossible until it's done.
Life is 10% of what happens to you and 90% of how you react to it.
